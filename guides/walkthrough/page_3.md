**Miscellaneous**
*Note* All commands in this category have an ephemeral argument, which hides the content sent from everyone else if True. This argument will not be listed in these parameters.
`guide`: Sends guides from the bot's github.
Paremeters: 
- name : Name of the guide to send
- paginate : Whether to paginate the guide. This is an optional argument.


`profile` : Sends the information set with the `set` command.


`stats` : Send bot stats. This does not have the ephemeral argument (why would it?)
