As the end of the school year approaches, I am taking preperations to stop the bot temporarily. **All health screenings will be set to paused after June 27, 2022.** If you are going to summer school/other summer progreams that require a health screening, send `/set` in the DMs with the bot in order to unpause your screenings. I am delivering this message now as an early reminder for the end of school. You will get additional followup messages one week prior to this action, one day prior to this action, and when the action is taken.

A second issue is what will happen to the bot for the 2022-23 school year. I am going to graduate this year, so it is unlikely for me to be actively developing the bot. However, **I will not step down as maintainer.** I will keep the bot running if health screenings will be needed for the 2022-23 school year. **If health screenings are _not_ needed for the 2022-23 school year, I will be shutting the bot down on August 12, 2022.** If health screenings are needed, everyone will be paused again, just like on the last day of school.
