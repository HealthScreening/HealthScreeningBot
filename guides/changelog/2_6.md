- Paginator auto disable has been fixed for non-ephemeral messages.
- Added `/test_screening` to page 2 of the walkthrough.
- Text commands (sending `hsb/generate_auto`) are now deprecated and will be removed by April 2022. Use `/generate_auto` instead. Currently, these commands will send a warning message every time.
- Added an **interactive** set menu that greatly simplifies the usage of the `/set` command. Now, instead of having to use 10+ options, the menu will allow you to click buttons and select choices for options. In addition, the menu will show you your profile after every change. In order to get the profile, use `/set` without any arguments. I highly recommend everyone that only uses the emails from the bot to turn on email-only mode using the menu.
- In the near future, **if you leave all mutual servers with the bot, you will be set to email only**. If you rejoin a mutual server with the bot, you *will* not be automatically restored to non-email-only status. You have to use `/set` to disable email only.
