__**Features and Improvements**__:
- You can now directly report bugs and file suggestions from the bot. The `/report_bug` command is used to file bugs and `/suggest` is used to file suggestions. 
- The third page of the walkthrough (`/guide name:walkthrough`) now contains the `/report_bug` and `/suggest` commands.
- The profile shown by `/profile` and the `/set` menu now both show the time in a 24-hour form and a 12-hour form.
- The profile shown by `/profile` and the `/set` menu now both show `00` instead of `0`.
- When you click the `+5 Minutes`/`-5 Minutes` buttons, the hours will increase/decrease if the minutes crosses through from 60 to 0 or from 0 to 60.

__**Removals**__:
- If you leave all mutual servers with the bot, you will be set to email only unless manually changed.
- If you are in the bot's server and your email ends with `@bxscience.edu`, `@stuy.edu` or `@bths.edu`, you will no longer receive the associated school role.
