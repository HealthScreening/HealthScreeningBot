- When running `/set_auto`, if the email-only check succeeds, the Post Set Auto message will be sent to your DMs instead of replying to the command invocation.
- The `ephemeral` option now actually works for `/generate_auto` and `/generate_once`.
- If you click any of the buttons on a paginator, or the paginator is non-ephemeral (such as running `/guide ephemeral:False`), the paginator will automatically disable the buttons after 120 seconds to reflect that the bot will no longer process paginator commands after that. **Note**: If you have an ephemeral paginator and do not click any buttons for 120 seconds, it will not work.
- The Post Set Auto guide has been updated to properly warn about leaving all mutual servers with the bot.
- Thanks to <@544621903315206280>, there is now a Walkthrough guide that properly explains all of the commands in the bot. Check it out by using `/guide name:walkthrough`.

*If you want to read this message again, use the `/guide name:whats_new_version_2_5` command.*
