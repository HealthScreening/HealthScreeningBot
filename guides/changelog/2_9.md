- The `/stats` command is now multi-paged. This will prevent errors where too many unique screening times causes the command to fail.
- The times shown in `/stats` are now sorted from smallest to largest.
- For `/test_screening`, the weekday names (`Will Run on <weekday>`) are now capitalized correctly.
- Some missing headings have been added to the `walkthrough` guide.
- The `contributing_a_guide` guide has been rewritten to more accurately help guide contributors.
- The `Go to DM` button will have the bot DM you a message first. This fixes a bug where if you have never started a DM with the bot then the button fails to work.
