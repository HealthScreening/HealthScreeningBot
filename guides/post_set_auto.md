Congratulations, you are now signed up for auto screenings!

Please check out the bot walkthrough by using `/guide name:walkthrough`.

Additionally, if you liked the bot, please share the bot with your friends! You can either share the invite link (https://discord.gg/yJbvcD4QBP) or [invite the bot to your own server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=890001571004448800&scope=applications.commands+bot).

**WARNING**: If you ever leave all servers with the health screening bot, you will be set to email only. If you rejoin a server, you *will* not be automatically restored to non-email-only status. You have to **manually** set `email-only` to False in `/set`.
