Running bot commands are simple: the bot uses slash commands.

The health screening bot allows commands to be run anywhere, including in bot DMs. Bot owners cannot access any DMs with the bot.

If you are worried about keeping your information secure, please use bot DMs.

To go to DMs click the "Go to DMs" button underneath this message.

__**Setup**__:

The command for setup is `/set_auto`, containing 4 mandatory fields.

When you type `/set_auto`, there should be a popup. Make sure you click that, or it *will not work*.

Then, click/tap on each field and type in the appropriate value. 

Note: The `vaccinated` field has two options, and you have to choose one of those two.

Once youâ€™re done, hit send. If you did not fill out every field, it will not let you send it. **Make sure all fields are filled out**.

If everything goes correctly, you should get a message saying Updated from the bot. If you see your first name, last name, and/or email, it **did not work** and you need to try again.
