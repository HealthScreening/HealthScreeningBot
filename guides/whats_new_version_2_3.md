This version introduces the following changes:

* No more invite links will be sent when you receive the daily screenings.
* Every screenshot will have a button that allows the person who generated the screenshot to delete it. Only they can delete it.
* Many commands will have an optional `ephemeral` parameter. If you set this to `True`, the messages sent by the command will only be visible to the user who sent the command.
* A proper quickstart.
* A full list of bot and server rules.
* A guide command, which allows you to pull up these "What's new" messages. Includes fancy autocomplete on the `name` field.
* Fancy new paginators. Any guide that has 2 or more pages will be paginated.

__**Guides**__

Guides are markdown files that are part of the bot's repository. You can get a list of guides by running `/guide name:guides`. 

Anyone is welcome to contribute their own guide. If you have an idea for a cool guide, [create a pull request in the bot's repository](https://github.com/HealthScreening/HealthScreeningBot).

*If you want to read this message again, use the `/guide name:whats_new_version_2_3` command.*
