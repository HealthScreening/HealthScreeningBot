__**Bot Rules**__

While it would be nice to let anyone do anything, there has to be some rules so that one person cannot ruin it for everyone else.

1. **No Harassment**: Do not intentionally create screenings with first and last names designed to spell out a message that can be seen as  harassing an individual or a group of people.

2. **No Spamming**: Do not spam the bot with generate requests with the intention of slowing down the bot.

3. **No Using the Bot to Fake Screenings**: Do not use the bot to generate fake health screenings. If you are sick and the bot sends you a completed health screening, disregard it. Do not lie about your vaccination status. Anyone lying to the bot will be banned from it.
