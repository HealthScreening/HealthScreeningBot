# Setting up Auto Screenings

The command for setup is [`/set_auto`](/commands/set-auto), containing 4 mandatory fields.

When you type /set_auto, there should be a popup. Make sure you click that, or it will not work.

Then, click on each field and type in the appropriate value. Remember that the “vaccinated” field has two options, and
you have to choose one of those two. Once you’re done, hit send. **If you did not fill out every field, it will not
let you send it.** Make sure all fields are filled out.

If everything goes correctly, you should get a message saying Updated from the bot. If you see your first name, last
name, and/or email, **it did not work** and you need to try again.
