# Running Commands

Running bot commands are simple: the bot uses slash commands.

All of the commands send non-ephemeral messages, or messages that are not private. For that reason, you need to consider
where the commands are run.

To see a list of the bot's commands, type `/` and scroll to the "Auto Health Screening" category. From there, you
can find the specific command you want, and click on it in order to run it, filling in arguments where necessary.

## Where to run commands

The health screening bot allows commands to be run anywhere, including in bot DMs. Bot owners cannot access any DMs with
the bot.

If you are worried about keeping your information secure, it is preferred to use bot DMs. However, if you want support
in case you are having issues with your screening, it is recommended to use the support channel located in the bot
server.
