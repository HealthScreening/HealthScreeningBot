# Suggestions

Suggestions are a way to provide feedback both about the bot and the bot server. The suggestion channels are located in
the Suggestions category.

## Making a Suggestion

To make a suggestion, go to [`#suggest-here`](#suggest-here) and run the command `!suggest` followed by a space and then
your suggestion. For example, I might write `!suggest Faster auto screenings`.

## Voting on Suggestion Requests

When considering suggestions, other users can vote on them. To vote, go to [`#suggestions`](#suggestions) and find the
suggestion to vote on. Click on either the up arrow to show **support** for the suggestion or the down arrow to show **
opposition** for the suggestion.

## Suggestion Log

Approved or denied suggestions are sent to a log channel. If you felt that a suggestion was denied unfairly, you can
make another suggestion. However, do not make too many suggestions, as this can be considered [spam](rules.md#no-spam).
