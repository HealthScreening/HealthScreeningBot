# Starboard

The Starboard is a feature that allows users to showcase exceptional messages to the `#starboard` channel.

## Adding a Message to the Starboard

In order to add a message to the starboard, at least three "star reactions" are required.

::: warning
If the star reaction count on a message added to a starboard goes below 3, **it will not be removed**. Contact a mod or
admin if you wish to remove the message from the starboard.

## Adding More Stars

All messages added to the starboard will have a star reaction added to them. Users can click on the star reaction to add
more stars to the message in addition to starring the original message.
