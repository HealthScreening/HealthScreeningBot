# Server Rules

Breaking a rule will result in a warning. It is up to the sole discretion of the server moderators to decide whether you
broke the rules.

## No Inappropriate Content

Do not post anything that can be deemed as “inappropriate”. This includes slurs, vulgar media, or anything else that
would be likely to get you in detention at any public high school.

### No Slurs

You are not allowed to use known racial and ethnic slurs, with the sole exception of if they are being discussed in a
philosophical manner. Furthermore, there are a few slurs that you cannot use under any conditions regardless of the
intent.

#### Completely Banned Slurs

N****r: This is the hard r form of the n word. There is no reason for anyone to use this form, and if you do want to
discuss the use of the n word, please refer to it as the “n word.” If a person is known to be Black (have African
ancestry), they can use the alternate form of the n word without the hard r.

### No Vulgar Media

Vulgar media can be defined as anything that is created with the explicit intent to be sexual. This includes:

* pictures and fictional representations (drawings, computer generated models) of people in revealing underwear
* pictures and fictional representations (drawings, computer generated models) of completely naked people
* pictures and fictional representations (drawings, computer generated models) of explicit sexual acts
* explicit text (erotica or any other text describing explicit sexual acts, even if there are no direct mentions of
  genitalia)
* direct links to any of the above

In addition, anything that is illegal, such as child pornography, incest, and/or beastiality, will result in a permanent
ban, even of fictional characters, and may result in reporting of the content to authorities.

## No Bullying and/or Harassment

Do not intentionally target a user for harassment. Harassment constitutes anything that consists of falsely accusing a
person of doing something they did not do, or repeatedly saying negative things about a person even after they asked the
person saying the things to stop. Harassment also includes “trolling” or “roasting” when the person who is the target of
such activities asks the perpetrator to stop.

### No Doxxing

Do not intentionally leak the names, social media handles, or other private information of a user with the intent to use
the information maliciously. If you do share private information about someone and they ask you to take it down, you are
required to take it down.

### No Spam

* Do not spam pings at a person, especially if they ask you to stop.
* Do not spam commands with the sole purpose of clogging up a channel.
* Do not spam suggestions, especially if they are being denied.
* Do not spam the reaction roles.

### No Discrimination

You are not allowed to discriminate against anyone on account of their

* race
* color
* religion
* sexual orientation
* gender identity
* national origin

Doing so almost guarantees an instant mute.

## Use Commands in Correct Places

Use commands inside of the trial zone only, unless you want support with the bot. In the case that your screening is not
working correctly, please contact the moderators.
