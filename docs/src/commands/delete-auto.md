## Arguments

_There are no arguments for this command._

::: danger
If you are using the command to reset your auto information, you should know that **your position will be reset**. The
bot starts working on screenings on a first-come first-serve basis, so by deleting your information and
re-using [`/set_auto`](set-auto.md), you are lowering your position in line. It is better to re-use `/set_auto`, since
it will update information without changing your placement.
