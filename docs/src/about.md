# About

The bot will visit the health screening website, complete the form, and take a screenshot of the final product.

In order to seem as legitimate as possible, the bot goes through the hard work and effort of **actually
completing the screening on the website as if an actual person completed the screening**. This means that you can
be rest assured that the bot will not land you in any trouble â€” it is indistinguishable from a real screening that you
would do yourself.

The bot utilizes the "Guest" mode in order to not require any usernames or passwords, as the OAuth mode requires.
