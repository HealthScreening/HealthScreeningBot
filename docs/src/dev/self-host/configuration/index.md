# Configuration

All configuration for the bot is stored inside a `config.json` file on the root of the project.

The configuration is split into three sections:

* [Database](database.md): Database configuration
* [Discord](discord.md): Discord configuration
* [Messages](messages.md): Messages that are sent by the bot
