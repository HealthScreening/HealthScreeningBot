# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation for the Health Screening Bot. This section assumes you have basic knowledge of
what the command line is, what [git](https://git-scm.com/) is, what a database is, and have some knowledge of how to
write code for contribution.

The bot’s code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a superset of JavaScript that uses static
type declarations. In order to actually understand what is going on in the code, you will need to have
intermediate-level knowledge of Typescript.

The bot’s dependencies are managed by the [npm package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The bot’s source code is hosted on the GitHub repository [https://github.com/PythonCoderAS/HealthScreeningBot](https://github.com/PythonCoderAS/HealthScreeningBot).
