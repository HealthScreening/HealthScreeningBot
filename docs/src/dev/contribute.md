# Contributing to the Bot

Contributing to the bot requires you to have a GitHub account. If you would like to submit a documentation modification,
it would be appreciated. Furthermore, if you would like to submit a code change, please make sure that the code compiles
into **valid TypeScript** first.

Most functions, enums, interfaces and type aliases have JSDoc comments that describe their purpose and
properties/arguments. In order to read them efficiently, it is recommended to use an IDE like WebStorm that is able to
understand JSDoc and be smart enough to process the `@link` directives being used.
