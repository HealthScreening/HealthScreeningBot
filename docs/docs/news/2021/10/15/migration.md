# Migration From MediaWiki Back to GitHub Pages

A week ago, I decided to migrate from GitHub pages to MediaWiki, citing the fact that it would be easier to edit the
information contained on the wiki. However, unlike GitHub Pages, MediaWiki has to be hosted on a host. I was hosting it
on my old laptop, but recently Spectrum has been doing work on the internet lines, and the server's internet connection
has gone out multiple times for up to several hours at a time. While the wiki _is_ easier to edit, is it also much more
unreliable, and I would rather not pay for hosting a wiki that isn't frequented enough to justify the cost. Therefore,
starting October 15, I am going to migrate all of the data from the wiki back into this site. At the end of the
migration, the server will be shut down and any URLs pointing to the wiki will cease to work.
