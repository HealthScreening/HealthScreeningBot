# School Admin Role

A @School Admin is someone who will coordinate the health screenings for their schools. A primary responsibility is
maintaining the server on that schoolâ€™s respective Hub. 

This will get you a shiny red role and **Administrator** permissions.

!!! warning
    Abuse of power will lead to an instant ban.

!!! note
    Only one person per school can be as school admin. I am the School Admin for the Bronx High School of Science.
