> I am happy to announce that today I have released a **queue system** for the health screening bot! The queue works like this: only 4 screenings can run at a time, and any additional screenings will require one of those 4 slots to be freed up. If your screening gets sent to the queue, you will be notified. Auto screenings will now be done 4 at a time in order to improve speed.

> Every school night and Sunday, the channel #trial-zone **will be cleaned** in order to better protect user privacy. This will likely occur somewhere around 10 PM.

> I have implemented cooldowns to the [`/generate_once`](../commands/generate-once.md) and [`/generate_auto`](../commands/generate-auto.md) commands in order to curb potential abuse of the bot.
