> I am happy to announce that today I have released a **queue system** for the health screening bot! The queue works like this: only 4 screenings can run at a time, and any additional screenings will require one of those 4 slots to be freed up. If your screening gets sent to the queue, you will be notified. Auto screenings will now be done 4 at a time in order to improve speed.
