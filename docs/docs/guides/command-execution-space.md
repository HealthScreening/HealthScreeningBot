# Running Commands

The health screening bot allows commands to be run anywhere, **including in bot DMs**. **_Bot owners cannot access any
DMs with the bot._**

If you are worried about keeping your information secure, it is preferred to use bot DMs. However, if you want support
in case you are having issues with your screening, it is recommended to
use [#trial-zone](https://discord.com/channels/889983763994521610/890026719891845201/896187885714288691).

# Starting a DM

In order to start a DM, go to the Direct Messages tab on Discord. On mobile this has a speech bubble icon, and is called
Direct Messages. On desktop this is the "Home" menu.

There will be a bar titled "Find or start a conversation". In it, type `AutoHealthScreening#9274`. This should have the
bot's profile as the only result. Click or tap on it. Now, you are ready to use commands in DMs.
