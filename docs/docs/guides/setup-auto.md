# Setup Auto Screenings

Once you have determined [where to run your commands](command-execution-space.md), setting up the bot is very simple.

The command for setup is [/set_auto](../commands/set-auto), containing 4 mandatory fields.

When you type `/set_auto`, there should be a popup. **Make sure you click that, or it will not work**.

* `First Name`: Your first name. For this field type in your first name.
* `Last Name`: Your last name. For this field type in your last name.
* `Email`: Your email. This does not have to point to your school email or even exist, but it has to be valid (in the form aaaa@bbbb.ccc). For this field type in the email you want to use.
* `Vaccinated`: Whether or not you are vaccinated. There should be a message with two options. Tap the value representing your vaccination status.
  * `True`: You are vaccinated.
  * `False`: You are not vaccinated.

If everything goes correctly, you should get a message saying `Updated` from the bot. If you see your first name, last name, and/or email, **it did not work and you need to try again**.
