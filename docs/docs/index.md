# Health Screening Bot

So you know the [health screening](https://healthscreening.schools.nyc/) that you have to complete every day in order to
get into a NYC high school? It's pointless, annoying, and generally a waste of time, but it doesn't have to be this way.

Introducing Health Screening Bot. It's a discord bot that **does the annoying part of the health screening for you**.
Now, every morning at around 6:00 AM New York City time, you just wake up, and in your DMs, is a completed health
screening.
